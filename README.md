This framework contains various Elegant Chaos utility classes that are specific to iOS devices. It builds upon the classes that are defined in the ECFoundation library.

These classes were written for my own use, so they aren't necessarily brilliantly documented at the moment, nor can I guarantee that the interface to them will remain unchanged.

That said, I'm open sourcing them in case anyone finds them useful.
